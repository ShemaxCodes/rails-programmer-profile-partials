# Programmer Partials Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice using partials.
2. Use all the different techniques you've learned in this unit.
3. DRY up your views with locals.

## Overview

We have a Rails app that showcases some of our favorite programmers. The landing
page is an index of all of the programmers, and users can click on each
programmer to see his or her profile page. There's just one problem: the views
are loaded with repetition and clunky iteration and could use some serious
refactoring. Your job is to clean up `programmers/index.html.erb` and
`programmers/show.html.erb` by using partials.

## Instructions

Fork and clone the lab. Run `bundle install` and `rake db:migrate`, then `rake
db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test`. Next, seed the database with some programmers - run
`rake db:seed` - and start the server to see the app in the browser.

Run `rspec` and make the tests pass one at a time! The app will continue to have
the same functionality (keep checking it in the browser), but you'll be making
the following partials to clean up the views:

1. A partial to render the navbar.
2. A partial to render all of the programmers on the index page.
